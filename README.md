# SQL

## Introduction

In the world of data management and database systems, SQL (Structured Query Language) is fundamental technology that play a crucial role. SQL is a standardized programming language used for managing and querying relational databases, while MySQL is one of the most popular open-source relational database management systems that can be used with various programming languages. In this comprehensive README, we will delve into the world of SQL and MySQL, exploring their importance, usage, and key concepts.
